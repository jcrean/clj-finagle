# clj-finagle

A Clojure wrapper around Twitter's Finagle RPC server/client

## Usage

Finagle is an asynchronous network stack for building RPC clients/servers. See https://github.com/twitter/finagle. This project aims to simplify some of the code needed to generate and work with these clients and servers. 

Finagle server/client interfaces can be generated by running Twitter's Scrooge compiler on Thrift IDL files. The first step is to create a Thrift IDL file describing your service. The following example will create the bare mininum to demonstrate usage of this library. For more information, check out http://thrift.apache.org.

#### Create Thrift IDL file to describe your service

    $ vi example.thrift

    service Example {
      void ping()
    }
